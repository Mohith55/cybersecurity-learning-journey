# Day 8 – Proxies & VPNs (Cybersecurity Fundamentals)

## Objective
To understand how proxies and VPNs are used in cybersecurity by both attackers and investigators.

## Key Concepts

### Proxy
- Acts as an intermediary between user and internet
- Can hide IP address
- Does NOT encrypt traffic by default
- Often used for filtering, caching, or basic anonymity

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Encrypts all network traffic
- Masks real IP address
- Protects data on public networks
- Used for privacy, secure access, and investigations

## Attacker vs Defender Perspective
- Attackers may use these tools to evade tracking
- Investigators use them to protect identity and sensitive work
- Logs, providers, and jurisdiction impact traceability

## Key Learning
Proxies and VPNs are neutral tools.
Understanding how they work is essential for:
- Ethical hacking
- Digital forensics
- Privacy protection
- Threat analysis

## Takeaway
Cybersecurity is about understanding intent, not labeling tools as good or bad.
