# Day 7 – Building Legal Hacking Labs (DVWA)

## Objective
To understand how ethical hackers practice offensive security techniques legally using controlled environments.

## Tool Used
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Kali Linux
- VirtualBox / VMware

## What is DVWA?
DVWA is an intentionally vulnerable web application designed to help security professionals
learn and practice common web vulnerabilities in a safe environment.

## Vulnerabilities Practiced
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Command Injection
- Brute Force Attacks
- CSRF

## Key Learnings
- Ethical hacking must always be performed in isolated lab environments
- Practicing on real systems without permission is illegal
- DVWA provides real-world attack simulations safely
- Understanding vulnerabilities helps in both offense and defense

## Takeaway
Real cybersecurity skills are built through responsible, legal, and ethical practice.
